👋 Hello, I'm Lokesh Reddy Vakada!
An Accomplished Python DevSecOps Engineer with over 4 years of hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure management, automation, and full-stack development. My mission is to bring efficiency and scalability to every project I work on through seamless automation and optimized CI/CD pipelines.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
Developing scalable CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes to automate deployments for cloud-native applications on AWS, Azure, and GCP. 🚀

🌱 I’m currently learning:
Advanced AWS services like Lambda, Fargate, and EventBridge to create serverless architectures, as well as Kubernetes Operators for automating cloud-native applications at scale.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
Open-source DevSecOps tools that improve automation and infrastructure management. Always excited to contribute to full-stack projects using Django, Flask, and React! 😎

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
Exploring more in-depth SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices and ways to build highly resilient, fault-tolerant systems using cloud infrastructure.

💬 Ask me about:
DevSecOps, Python, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), CI/CD pipelines, or anything related to automation and cloud infrastructure management.
